This is my homework assignment that covers the material from the PyBank and PyPoll assignments. I pushed those actual assignments to github awhile ago, but they were basically just copies of other people's work with comments and a few things changed. To verify that I am actually learning and using what we are studying, I used those same libraries and methods to write a python script that identifies which of the electric scooters at my work need to be plugged in at any given time. (The scooters are ridden around by the general public, and they're supposed to be plugged in when they get parked in garages, but not every rider remembers to do this, so field technicians must correct this when they're out repairing vehicles.)

"Access groups" are the categories assigned to a vehicle at any given time, based on who should be able to turn them on and off.

I tried to make an .ipynb file to turn in so that you could look at the code in Jupyter notebooks, including a glimpse at the dataframe (so you could get familiar with the unfamiliar spreadsheet), but it turned into a gigantic mess. Please just check out the .csv file in Excel to get an idea of what it looks like.

It's a bit inelegant, but I worked hard on it, and I'm proud of the result. It's a beginning. 

Additionally, I'm not including the .csv files (which are essentially the property of my employer) in my public github repo, but rather I'm sending them to you through Slack. I'm also taking serioualy the lessons you're teaching us about being cautious with things like API keys when we're working with public repositories.

Thanks to the whole UCBE instruction team.
